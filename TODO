In create_graph.py, the threshold for deleting short nodes is
hard-coded on line 199. This threshold should be a paramater.

The visualization script does not work as it can not handle deleted
short nodes that have no classification label: it woud be better if
the classification ascript would output them as unlabelled.

Generally, handling short contigs should be more robust.
