In create_graph.py, the threshold for deleting short nodes is
hard-coded on line 199. This threshold should be a paramater.

The visualization script does not work as it can not handle deleted
short nodes that have no classification label: it woud be better if
the classification ascript would output them as unlabelled.

Generally, handling short contigs should be more robust.

Rethinking the input and output to eliminate elements that were tied
to the paper experiments?

Avoiding to have to specify as a parameter the directory to access
datas and requiring absolute path names fotr GFA files?
